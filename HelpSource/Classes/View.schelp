summary:: The basic visible element of GUI
categories:: GUI

DESCRIPTION::
The View class is the superclass of all view classes.

The view is the basic visible element of which the graphical user interface is composed. It occupies a rectangular space on screen within which it draws itself to display some data or to indicate a mode of interaction between the user and the program. Views receive keyboard and mouse events generated by the user and respond to them by controlling the behavior of the program. They also display information about the state of the program and the data on which it operates.



CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new

Creates a new instance of View and makes it a child of another View or Window, effectively placing it within the parent's visual space. If there is a link::#-decorator#decorator:: installed on the parent, it will manage the position of the new View.

note::

strong::Qt GUI: ::

The 'parent' argument may be omitted, in which case the view will be displayed as a window on its own, when link::Classes/QView#-front#shown::.

The 'bounds' argument may be omitted, in which case the view will be created with its preferred size at position (0,0).

If a parent is given and there is a layout installed on it, the layout will manage the position and size of this view and the 'bounds' argument will have no effect.
::

argument:: parent
The instance of View or Window that the new View will become a child of.

argument:: bounds
A Rect or a Point describing size and position of the new View. If a Point is given, its coordinates will denote the view's size, while the view's position will be (0,0). The view's position coordinates are relative to its parent.

returns::
note::
SuperCollider has different GUI kits implementing the same functionality on different platforms. The View's constructor will return an instance of the equivalent class of the currently active GUI kit. See link::Guides/GUI-Introduction:: for detailed explanation.
